# Starterproject Django 4.2 with tailwind and alpine.js

This project is a starter template designed to streamline the development of Django applications with integrated Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js. It includes a basic setup with one pre-configured Django app named `client`, which serves as an example to demonstrate how to define models and integrate frontend technologies.

## Project Description

The starter template provides a robust foundation for building modern web applications using Django, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js. The template aims to simplify the initial setup and configuration, allowing developers to focus on building their application's unique features.
